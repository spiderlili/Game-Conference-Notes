# What is ADHD (Attention Hyperactivity Disorder)?
3 Types:
1. Inattentive
2. Hyperactive
3. Combined

# How can ADHD mainfest?
- Time blindness: late or early
- Overwhelm in social situations or lots of sounds
- Short term hobby hyperfixation
- Brain too much, too fast
- Getting stuck / fixated on one step if there are multiple steps of the process
- Bredom is painful

# How does this relate to games?
- UKIE 2022 Diversity Census: 10% of respondents believe they have ADHD, up from 3% in 2020
- Approximately 4% of the UK population have ADHD
- ADHD-ers are everywhere in games & make up a huge number of players too
- Games are an industry that ADHD-ers thrive in

# Things ADHD-ers are good at
- Idea generation
- Flowing from one idea to the next
- Deep, specific knowledge of subject matter
- Good in a crisis
- Great generalists
- Excellent leadership
- Working in video games

# Anna's experience with ADHD
- Always been a bit weird
- Thrived within structure
- Anxiety, guilt and shame are great at keeping things together - to a point, can only brute force things for so long
- Harnessing of traits (broad interest in many art forms) to speed boost career
- Struggling with faces and names
- Trapping myself in situations to get things done

# Diagnosis
- NHS: longer wait times but is free, worth getting on the waiting list regardless 
- Right to Choose: utilises a private practice with NHS funding
- Private: faster, but expensive. Titration (finding the right medication) can be better supported
  - Some NHS GPs won't accept diagnoses or won't prescribe medication until you've been on one for a while

# Core Strategies
- Identify your challenges
  - Organisation
  - Focus
  - Overwhelm 
- Externalising your brain
  - Timeline Notion Boards / Google Calendar / Spreadsheet / Journals
  - Schedule time to do future tasks 
  - Prioritise in advance
  - Cut out everything that makes it annoying - or you won't use it
- Artificial (or very real) urgency
  - Deadlines
  - Timers
- Body doubling
  - Twitch streaming, Google Meets, Discord voice channels
  - Study with me videos 
- Exercise & sleep
  - The period after exercise makes our brains less busy 
  - Getting up, moving quickly or bouncing around can help you reset
  - Hyperfocus or procrastination can make sleep very delayed: be protective about sleep!
- Make sure you're comfortable in your workspace
  - Temperature: weighted blanket as a desk trap
  - Visual interest: decorations, desk mat

# Systems, not habits
- ADHD-ers tend to be not so good at sticking to self-defined schedules
- Novelty-seeking means we like to change things up
- Build systems based on energy levels & interests
  - PDF of shortcuts to memorise on low energy days
  - Flexible schedule of 30 min to 2 hours a day 
- Now and not now - make now easier (.e.g.plugging things in ahead of time)

# Meds
- Not necessarily a silver bullet but very helpful
- Everyone works differently on them
- Protein 
- Eat breakfast

# Art focused tips
- Circle the things you need to come back to in a screenshot
- When you've finished a piece: set up the next one so you aren't intimidated by a blank canvas / empty 3D scene next work session
- Work with multiple projects open
- Save specific tasks for certain times of day
- Focus on themes to work in rather than deep discipline specialisation

# Working with a team structure

- Ask your line manager for shorter deadlines, or more regular checkins

  - Written feedback in actionable bullet points
  - Conversations to help understsand further

# Overview
- Technical skills are beneficial to creatives, but many creative individuals shudder at the thought of learning Python or other technical skills and block themselves from reaching their full potential. 
- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable: it's OK to be afraid! 
- Develop preserverance, be honest about what you don't know and get support.

## How Creative Brains Work
_"We won't be able to understand the brain. It is the most complex thing in the universe." - Professor Sir Robin Murray_
- Debunking the myth of Left brain people (logical) vs Right brain people (creative): originated from Roger Sperry's Split Brain experiments in the 1960s, but in 2013 the University of Utah concluded there was no evidence for people having a dominant side after analysing thousands of MRI scans. Everyone is able to use their entire brain equally. 
- Highly creative people have significantly more white matter connections between the right brain & the left brain, jumping between both brains a lot.
- Neuroplasticity: the brain's ability to change & adapt, this can happen at any age.
- Creative people are capable of technical thinking, and vice versa.

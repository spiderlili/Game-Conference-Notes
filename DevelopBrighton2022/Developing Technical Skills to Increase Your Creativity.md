# Overview
_"Become technical. You can learn that. If you're creative and technical you're unstoppable!" - Robert Rodriguez_
- Technical skills are beneficial to creatives, but many creative individuals shudder at the thought of learning Python or other technical skills and block themselves from reaching their full potential. Developing technical skills and learning skills in new areas will increase your creativity by creating new pathways in your brain.
- Get comfortable with being uncomfortable: it's OK to be afraid! 
- Preserverance is key: be honest about what you don't know and get support.
- Don't work in isolation.

# How Creative Brains Work
_"We won't be able to understand the brain. It is the most complex thing in the universe." - Professor Sir Robin Murray_
- Debunking the myth of Left brain people (logical) vs Right brain people (creative): this myth originated from Roger Sperry's Split Brain experiments in the 1960s, but in 2013 the University of Utah concluded there was no evidence for people having a dominant side after analysing thousands of MRI scans. Everyone is able to use their entire brain equally. 
- Highly creative people have significantly more white matter connections between the right brain & the left brain, jumping between both brains a lot.
- Neuroplasticity: the brain's ability to change & adapt, this can happen at any age.
- Creative people are capable of technical thinking, the only limitations are the limitations that you're putting on yourself.

# Developing Technical Skills
### 5 Steps To Evaluate your skill set:
1. Write a hard & soft skills list with a rating of [1 - 10] to indicate your level in each area.
2. Compare your skillset against job descriptions to identify if there are any gaps.
3. Look at your past feedback: you should be getting feedback on a regular basis.
4. Get new feedback: identify where you are in the curve.
5. Prioritise: what skills should you focus first?

### Why should artists learn Technical Skills like Python?
- Efficiency: remove repetition, work smarter & fasterrather than harder
- Collboration: better communication & less friction
- Employability: many game roles that require both creative & technical skills

### How to develop technical skills?
- Exchange skills: mentor each other, help each other out with hurdles
- Game Jams
- Online courses

### The Habit Loop: Make New Habits Stick
1. Trigger
2. Action
3. Reward

## The Future of Technical vs Creative
- Node-based software for artists to do things themselves instead of asking programmers, more new roles that require creative & technical balance.
- Traditional Education pushes us to specialise: Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at university level, we're losing out on the middle ground and we have to change, otherwise it will continue to be difficult to recruit people for those new roles.

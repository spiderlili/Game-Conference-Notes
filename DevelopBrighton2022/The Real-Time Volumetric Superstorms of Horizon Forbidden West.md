# Overview
- Real-time Volumetric Cloud systems in Games have seen increasing adoption by game developers in the past few years. 
- Many systems use a coverage/type map based modeling method combined with an optimized ray-march and shading solution similar to or expanded upon what was described in detail in the SIGGRAPH 2015 Publication, The Real-Time Volumetric Cloudscapes of Horizon Zero Dawn. 
- How Guerrilla expanded its Nubis cloud system without using expensive simulations or lighting calculations so that the system could scale between current & previous-gen Playstation consoles, including:
  - Tornadic superstorms
  - Internal lighting 
  - Lightning flashes
  - A solution to render faster moving clouds with temporal upscaling as well as visual enhancements

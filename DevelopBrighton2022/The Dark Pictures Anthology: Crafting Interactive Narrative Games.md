# Overview
- The processes that Supermassive Games employs to craft branching narrative adventures
- The biggest choice of all: Quality <=> Variety
- Techniques for creating horror in the Dark Pictures Anthology: a series of intense, cinematic horror stories
- Each title is standalone & examines a different horror subgenre
- Control a cast of characters: your decisions shape their story
- Everyone can live or everyone can die: no checkpoints or restarts. If your character dies, the story continues without them
- Playable in single player or multiplayer

# Interactive Narrative Games
- _"A game with a strong story, where the player's path through the game is shaped by their choices & actions."_
- Gameplay > Decision Point > Consequence
  - Dungeons of Dragons
  - The Warlock of Firetop Mountain
  - JRR Tolkien

## Rules of Interactive Narrative Games
- Fairness: the game offers me fair choices
  - Consequences are foreshadowed
  - Choices are contrasting
  - Choices present dilemmas
  - Outcomes are as expected
  - Decision points are consistent 
- Drama: the story is compelling
  - Consequences are dramatic
  - Choices affect characters
  - Choices determine character responses 
- Agency: my choices affect the story in meaningful ways
  - Consequences are responsive
  - Branching is signalled
  - Choices lead to different outcomes 

## Blocking out your story
- High concept: create a solid log line
  - "Two married couples with secrets to hide are tricked into staying on a cursed island over Halloween." 
- Beats
  - Consider the key beats of your story. What's the backbone? 
  - What are your game's major decision points?
  - What are your story's "fun and games" moments?
- Characters
  - What are their archetypes?
  - What are their B-story themes?
  - What are their arcs?
  - Avoid schizophrenic behaviour
  - Make your characters likeable

# Horror Techniques
- Create a flow chart by the end of your early design for each Act: allocate characters across the scenes

## Consequences
- A & B for every scene
- If a scene can't branch: it's a railroad
- Show off your branching
- Use NPCs to remind players that events are influenced by previous choices
- "Thank god you did (X)"
- "If only you'd done (X)"

## Fear
Stephen King - 3 types of horror:
1. Gross-out
2. Horror
3. Terror

## Horror Moments
1. Gore
2. Creature
3. Jump-scare: _"A vampire is seen inside a hole in the wall, crawling slowly out of view. If a character shines their torch on it, the vampire hisses and dashes away quickly"_ 
5. Horror: _"The marines hear Joey calling from the dark ahead. But Joey is supposed to be dead?"
6. Fake-out
7. Suspense: _"A bang is heard from the room ahead, putting the marines on high alert. The lamp in the room flickers ominously."_
8. Psychological
9. Death
10. Chase

## Into the Unknown: Crossing the threshold
- The safe world => World of terror
- Suspense works best when we enter the unknown or leave our comfort zone
- Isolation: find ways to isolate characters in the story

## Build Suspense
- Signal the fear: let your audience know when they should be scared
- Exploit fake-outs: create a flow of pressure and release
- Use slow reveals: every time you see something scary, it loses its terror
- Show the fear: engineer moments where your protagonists experience real fear
- Use jump scares effectively: a well-timed shock can terrify your players

## Exploit Sound
- Audio is essential for building tension: riser => gap => sting
- Understand the power of silence

## Best Practices
1. Build Tension
2. Create illusion of safety
3. Distract eye line
4. Sudden audio sting

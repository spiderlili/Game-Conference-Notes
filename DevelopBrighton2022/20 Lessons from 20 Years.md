# What are the biggest Lessons you've learned over 20 Years?
1. More diverse game developers are bringing new perspectives: talk to them & hear what they have to say. Both Juniors and Seniors can learn a lot from each other. - Dinga Bakaba
2. You're only as good as your team. If you want to do something memorable, you need a great team that buys into a clear vision. Lay out the appropriate success criteria for a game: for some it's about making lots of money while reaching many people, some define it as hitting a budget or schedule, some find it as advancing the state of the art in ways that influence other game makers, or making games people will still be talking about 20 years later. Failures happen to even the best teams, but we have to be able to say we gave it our best shot. Get out of the way & let the team loose as long as they don't stray from the vision of success, they'll conceive & build things better than you can imagine. - Warren Spector
3. Make 2 checklists when deciding on a hire or a publisher deal: Primary Checklist - why should you hire this person / do this deal? Secondary Checklist - why should you not hire this person / do this deal (.e.g. affiliation with hate groups, dictatorial tendencies, etc)? Pay close attention to the Secondary Checklist even if a person has ticked every single box in the Primary Checklist. You will spend far more time on your hiring failures than you will on the great people. Root that out as quickly as you can, do not let any of that in, otherwise it will cause you great difficulty. - Brenda Romero
4. Don't be afraid to listen to yourself, make something that directly follows your own curiosities & desires rather than trying to please an audience. The more specific and personal it is, the greater the chance that when the game is finished there will be people for whom that game really resonates with. Think about the game you want to play that doesn't exist and call that into existence. -  Sam Barlow
5. Don't give up even if it's stressful. - Caroline Marchal
6. Things are often easier done than said. Don't be shy about being hands-on, reactive and supportive to make sure you have the best info possible. You can spend a lot of time debating and wondering what the truth of something is, or you can take steps to resolve it through playable proveable prototypes. Decision making is about information - it's not about time, often a physical interactive playable prototype will give you the information you need. - Aaryn Flynn 
7. Make sure good people have the tools to stay. As an industry, we've slowly gotten better but there's a lot left to do. We started talking about crunch, working conditions, mental health, representation, marginalisation, and fair power structures, but ultimately they're all saying the same thing - we want good people to stay. Don't let anybody do anything that damage your ability to stay. If someone tells you to overwork, it is never worth it. If someone is being a bully, talk to people and make sure they end up paying for what they're doing. Fight for other people's ability to stay. - Rami Ismail
8. Owning intellectual property is fundamental to the value of any company, greater value will be established through these IP. Do not be afraid of failure, it's just success working in progress. It's important to partner with someone who knows the business side of the games industry.
9. If red lines are being crossed, just fire that person to protect your team. - Allan Cudico

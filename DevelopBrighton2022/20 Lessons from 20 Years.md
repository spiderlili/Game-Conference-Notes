# 20 Lessons
1. More diverse game developers are bringing new perspectives: talk to them & hear what they have to say. Both Juniors and Seniors can learn a lot from each other. - Dinga Bakaba
2. You're only as good as your team. If you want to do something memorable, you need a great team that buys into a clear vision. Lay out the appropriate success criteria for a game: for some it's about making lots of money while reaching many people, some define it as hitting a budget or schedule, some find it as advancing the state of the art in ways that influence other game makers, or making games people will still be talking about 20 years later. Failures happen to even the best teams, but we have to be able to say we gave it our best shot. Get out of the way & let the team loose as long as they don't stray from the vision of success, they'll conceive & build things better than you can imagine. - Warren Spector

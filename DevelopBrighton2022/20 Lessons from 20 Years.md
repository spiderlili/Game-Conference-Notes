# 20 Lessons from 20 Years
1. More diverse game developers are bringing new perspectives: talk to them & hear what they have to say. Both Juniors and Seniors can learn a lot from each other. - Dinga Bakaba
2. You're only as good as your team. If you want to do something memorable, you need a great team that buys into a clear vision. Lay out the appropriate success criteria for a game: for some it's about making lots of money while reaching many people, some define it as hitting a budget or schedule, some find it as advancing the state of the art in ways that influence other game makers, or making games people will still be talking about 20 years later. Failures happen to even the best teams, but we have to be able to say we gave it our best shot. Get out of the way & let the team loose as long as they don't stray from the vision of success, they'll conceive & build things better than you can imagine. - Warren Spector
3. Make 2 checklists when deciding on a hire or a publisher deal: Primary Checklist - why should you hire this person / do this deal? Secondary Checklist - why should you not hire this person / do this deal(.e.g. affiliation with hate groups, dictatorial tendencies, etc)? Pay close attention to the Secondary Checklist even if a person has ticked every single box in the Primary Checklist. You will spend far more time on your hiring failures than you will on the great people. Root that out as quickly as you can, do not let any of that in, otherwise it will cause you great difficulty. - Brenda Romero
4. Don't be afraid to listen to yourself, make something that directly follows your own curiosities & desires rather than trying to please an audience. The more specific and personal it is, the greater the chance that when the game is finished there will be people for whom that game really resonates with. Think about the game you want to play that doesn't exist and call that into existence. -  Sam Barlow
5. Don't give up even if it's stressful. - Caroline Marchal

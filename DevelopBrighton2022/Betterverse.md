# Overview
The world we live in, both physical and digital, is built on cultural and societal considerations. These considerations shape the metaverse and the possibility space of what it can become. Who determines what those considerations are? What gets left out, and what gets brought in? Our metaverses are mirrors of their creators. This time time, let's do it right.

## Cyber Space
- The term "Cyber Space" was original coined by William Gibson in 1982, he greatly expands on it in Neuromancer in 1984. He warned us about the dark side of AI going wrong.
- The big problem: didn't get to play as a female character until 1987 [(Leather Goddesses of Phobos)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_Goddesses_of_Phobos).

Speaker: [Brenda Romero, CEO at Romero Games](http://brenda.games/)

# Overview
The world we live in, both physical and digital, is built on cultural and societal considerations. These considerations shape the meta verse and the possibility space of what it can become. In this talk, Brenda Romero asks who determines what those considerations are? What gets left out, and what gets brought in? Our metaverses are mirrors of their creators. This time time, let's do it right.

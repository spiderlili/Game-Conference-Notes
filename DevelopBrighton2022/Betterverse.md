# Overview
The world we live in, both physical and digital, is built on cultural and societal considerations. These considerations shape the metaverse and the possibility space of what it can become. Who determines what those considerations are? What gets left out, and what gets brought in? Our metaverses are mirrors of their creators. The first time of metaverse was not good for many people, This time time, let's do it right.

## Cyber Space & The Big Problem
- The term "Cyber Space" was original coined by William Gibson in 1982, he greatly expands on it in Neuromancer in 1984. He warned us about the dark side of AI going wrong.
- The big problem: nothing says "you don't belong in my metaverse" like not being able to choose to play as yourself. We didn't get to play as a female character until 1987 [(Leather Goddesses of Phobos)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_Goddesses_of_Phobos), while the first digital game goes back to 1954. Even our most iconic characters like Princess Peach needs to be rescued. 
- In the original Sims: gay characters can't marry or even fall in love.
- Blizzard administrators forced a queer-friendly guild in World of Warcraft to change its name from "GAY BOYS" to "Guild ZFXPK", a random string of letters chosen by an algorithm. The gay community responded with a gay cruise, which was the first civil rights protest in a virtual world.
- Rockstar's [Bully](https://www.rockstargames.com/games/bully) was massively controversial because guys could kiss.
- Assassin's Creed Unity (2014): [Ubisoft abandoned women assassins in co-op because of additional work](https://www.polygon.com/e3-2014/2014/6/10/5798592/assassins-creed-unity-female-assassins#:~:text=Share%20All%20sharing%20options%20for,because%20of%20the%20additional%20work&text=Assassin's%20Creed%20Unity's%20four%2Dplayer,Polygon%20during%20a%20recent%20interview.)
- [Hearthstone tournament explains why women aren't allowed to play (2014)](https://www.pcgamer.com/hearthstone-tournament/)
- [Atlanta FaZe Esports Team face backlash for blatant misogyny (2022)](https://www.thegamer.com/faze-clan-members-face-backlash-blatant-misogyny/)

## Making A Hero
_"Because they represent heroes, male and female avatars will often exhibit exaggerated physical signals of youth, strength, and fertility / virility." - Sheri Graner Ray, [Gender Inclusive Game Design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Gender-Inclusive-Game-Design-Development/dp/1584502398)_

### Second Life: Anshe Chung
- [Anshe Chung](http://anshechung.com/) made a lot of money in virtual real estate & was featured on Business Week's cover.
- Her interview was disrupted by flying animated penises when she appeared in a talk show.

### The Brown Slider
- Take a Caucasian person and make them look darker, does not take into account what different races look like. 
- We have the technology to make people feel like they're part of the world.
- Sid Meier's Colonization: outdated narratives about barbarians
- IGDA Statistics about the industry in games: 81% Caucasian, 8% Asian, 7% Hispanic / Latino, 2.5% Arabian / West Asian.
- Largely one-sided mechanics in video games: conquest, colonization, resource capture, murder

### Positive Examples: "We Want Heroes"
- DEATHLOOP (Juliana Blake)
- Gone Home
- Life is Strange

# How do we build a betterverse?
- Diversify the makers: 
  - women are less than a third of tech workers. Of those tech workers, only a fifth are in leadership positions. The results of this are non-trivial to our health, wellbeing, education, enjoyment and success. 
  - Hand sizes do matter: adult female (length: 17.2cm, width: 7.4cm) vs adult male (length: 18.9cm, width: 8.4cm), Apple discontinued the phone that fits the best in a woman's hand (iPhone SE) in 2018. While this looks great in marketing, the reality is it's easier to play on smaller phones if you have a woman's hands. Designing for the biggest mobile screen possible is actually leaving some people out.
  - [_"Welcome to the big screens!" says Apple and women like me with small hands who needs the most secure phone for safety reasons are stuck with something they can't hold and constantly risk dropping. Company that designs $5 billion headquarters without a childcare center for the win. - Zeynep Tufekci_](https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1040213186744655872)
  - What's considered "Standard Size" should account for all their customers.
  - [Amazon's hiring AI is biased against women and they had to get rid of the program in 2018](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G)
  - On Github: women's contributions are rated higher and accepted more often then men, unless their gender was known - it drops by 20%. [_Source: Peer Reviewed: Gender Differences and Bias in Open Source: Pull Request Acceptance of Women Versus Men (2017)_](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-111/)
  - Black people were facing racial discrimination on Zoom meetings through "ZoomBombing" decapitation due to their skin color not being recognised.
  - US government tests find even top-performing facial recognition systems misidentify Black people at rates 5 - 10 times higher than they do Caucasian people, which resulted in people being mistakenly put in prison.
- Clear the barriers & dispel the myths: 
  - Make sure we have the most well-rounded team possible, because study after study shows diverse teams make better products. 
  - "Women don't play video games": Women in the US own more consoles (Xbox / PlayStation) than men.
  - "Girls aren't good at maths and IT": At one point in time, programming jobs were advertised to women specifically and they were the majority of programmers, because they required menial, detail-oriented labour. IBM UK measured the manufacturing of computers in “girl hours” (which were less expensive than “man hours”) until the 1970s. The ZX Spectrum computer was entirely built by women. As the importance of computers started to go up, the pay started to go up. Men were uncomfortable with being trained by women.

  - Women built the foundation of metaverse, games and Computer Science: Kateryna Yushchenko (Pointers), Kathleen Booth (Assembly), Margaret Hamilton, Lois Mitchell, Melba Roy, Sister Mary Kenneth Keller, Alexandra Illmer Forsythe, Dona Bailey, Roberta Williams, Dani Berry..
- Curate the community:
  - The curation should not favour profit over people.
  - Protect vulnerable groups online.
  - We have all the ingredients needed to do it well. Invest in community curation.

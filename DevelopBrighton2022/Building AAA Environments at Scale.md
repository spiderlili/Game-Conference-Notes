- AAA Games are getting bigger and more detailed all the time and players are expecting more than ever before. It is quickly becoming a reality to design and create large-scale AAA worlds not only with a high amount of detail but also to a tight deadline.
- Developing a framework in which we can achieve highly detailed art whilst still maintaining high production standards, and ultimately creating detail-rich worlds that are attainable.
- This discussion is aimed more towards leads, managers, and those wishing to become leads.

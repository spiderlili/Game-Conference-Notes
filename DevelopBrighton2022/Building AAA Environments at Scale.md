# Overview
- AAA Games are getting bigger and more detailed all the time and players are expecting more than ever before. It is quickly becoming a reality to design and create large-scale AAA worlds not only with a high amount of detail but also to a tight deadline.
- Developing a framework in which we can achieve highly detailed art whilst still maintaining high production standards, and ultimately creating detail-rich worlds that are attainable.
- This discussion is aimed more towards leads, managers, and those wishing to become leads.
  - Team-building
  - Team structure
  - Stages of a AAA project
  - Navigating each stage in the project
  - Handling hurdles & unknowns
  - Attaining AAA standards in a short amount of time

# Team structure & culture
- Team Building
  - Identify what you are looking for in a team
  - Team culture
  - Needs of the project should come first
  - What should each artist be working on?
- Example Team Structure (Sharkmob)
  - Art Director > Lead Artist > Art Discipline Team Leads: Terrain, Assets, Foliage, Geology, Project-specific > Artists
  - Dedicated Producer for the team

# Project Structure
1. Concept: getting the team & disciplines together, investigations, tech requests, exploration
2. Pre-production: vertical slice, scoped & production, benchmarking at scale (procedural methods)
3. Production: planning for the unkonwn, reviews, table of specific dates & tasks of each artist should work on throughout the months, what happens when things go wrong? triage & prioritise, taskforces for contingencies
4. Shutdown: split milestones into polish & bug fix, bug number targets, play testing, marketing, looking at the next big thing

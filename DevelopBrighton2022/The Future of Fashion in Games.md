# Overview
- Despite being two industries focused on creativity, new technology and playfulness, fashion and games were two worlds that, for a long time, were totally separate. 
- This changed rapidly as we moved our lives online in the pandemic, and created a surge of interest from the fashion world in what games could mean for their brands and collections. 
- From [Balenciaga's FW/21 runway show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL_eZZp6U5g) existing within Unreal Engine, to designers partnering with Animal Crossing creators to bring their collections to life in game, the fashion industry has never been more interested in games as a medium.
- Many game developers are stepping into this world, through partnerships, metaverse experience design or simply through more considered approaches to the fashion in their games.

# Fashion + Games
- Fashion is something we all engage with - in our real lives, and in games. From choosing our outfits for a conference, to buying skins in game. For some of us it's a means to an end, for others it's a passion and a reason to play.
- The worlds of fashion and games are colliding, from luxury brand partnerships to fashion consultants working with teams to build inclusive outfits. The fact is, fashion has relevance (and lucrative opportunities!) no matter the sort of game you're building.
- In [Drest](https://drest.com/): players use luxury fashion to dress up models based on briefs from industry fashion editors, then other players vote on their style.

- Digital self-representation is increasingly important as we live more of our lives in augmented realities. Whether it's becoming an anime catgirl in 
VRChat, or a Snapcam filter on Zoom, digital worlds are safe spaces to explore our identities - and fashion comes along with that.
- Brand partnerships can be a great way to bring the fantasy of fashion to your players when you prioritise a meaningful player experience.
 events where players engage with branded content INCREASE key retention and player satisfaction metrics!

# Consumables
- The changing attitudes to skins and cosmetics: from the controversy / memes around Oblivion Horse Armour in 2006, to 2022 when $50 skins are the norm.
- Players do change their minds
- Cosmetics (and showing them off) are meaningful FOR SOME

# What about the metaverse, NFTs etc?
- Currently, the Fashion industry is largely pro-NFT while the majority of game developers have no interest in NFTs[(_Source: State Of The Game Industry 2022 surveyâ€™s findings_)](https://kotaku.com/nft-crypto-cryptocurrency-blockchain-gdc-video-games-de-1848407959)
- Strategy will depend on platform, infrastructure and userbase: IP holders _MAY_ introduce transferable items in the future if there's a monetary and player experience benefit.
- Fashion in games is meaningful for us all, no matter what NFTs and the metaverse become. It can be a massive benefit to your player experience - fashion is here to stay!
